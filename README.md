# RIT-Gordon-Field-House-Pool-Sign-In

Prior to the creation of this Android application, the RIT Gordon Field House Pool used a binder to track all of their sign ins. And as was expected, many swimmers would bypass the binder and jump in. I worked with David Stevens, Director of the RIT Center for Recreational Sports and Randal Lewis, Aquatics Manager to build an simple application that would be more accessible and user friendly. The whole application is five large buttons, each one a different affiliation with RIT. Swimmers simply tap on their affiliation (Student, Faculty, etc. ) and Google Analytics takes over. Google Analytics replaced the manual calculating of a binder, pen, and paper, and is able to deliver real-time statistics about who uses the facility when.

Tools, Technologies, and Languages I Used:
  •	Kotlin
  •	Google Analytics
